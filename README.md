# SwinTransformer-Replicate

This project is an implementation of the Swin Transformer model, designed for replicating its architecture and training pipeline. The Swin Transformer is a state-of-the-art vision transformer architecture, known for its hierarchical feature extraction and efficiency in handling visual data.

## Project Overview

The **SwinTransformer-Replicate** project focuses on reproducing the Swin Transformer model for image classification and other vision-related tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and utility functions to streamline the workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SwinTransformer-Replicate
    ```
    
2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

## Running the Project

### 1. Set Up Data

To prepare the dataset, run the following script:

```
python data_setup.py
```

This script handles data downloading, preprocessing, and organizing into the required structure for training.

### 2. Train the Model

To train the Swin Transformer model, execute:

```
python train.py
```

This script includes the full training pipeline, utilizing the Swin Transformer architecture and necessary utilities.

### 3. Build the Model

If you want to initialize or build the Swin Transformer model separately, use:

```
python model_builder.py
```

### 4. Utilities

The `utils.py` script provides additional helper functions that support tasks such as logging, saving checkpoints, and visualization. These utilities are integrated into the main scripts but can also be used independently.
